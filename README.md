**Electric Vehicle Population Analysis - EDA Project**
***Introduction:-***
Analyzed the dataset on Electric vehicle population spanning multiple years up to the present year.Utilized advanced data visualization techniques to present key insights in a reader-friendly manner.
Illustrated the distribution of electric vehicles, including types and usage trends.

***Tech Stack Used:-***
**1.Warnings**: - This library is used to manage warnings in Python. In the code, warnings.filterwarnings('ignore') is used to ignore warning messages.

**2.Pandas**:- It is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data, like pd.read_csv (for reading csv files), cleaning the empty rows and columns.

**3. Numpy** :- NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical and mathematical operations in Python. It provides support for arrays and matrices. While it's not explicitly used in the code of dataset analysis, it is often used in conjunction with pandas for numerical computations.

**4. Matplotlib. Pyplot:** - It is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc. Like as plt.plot(), plt.show(), plt.figure().

**5.Seaborn:** - It is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics, like sns.pairplot(for bivariate analysis), sns.boxplot(for boxplot), sns.countplot(), sns.subplot(), etc.
**6.SciPY:** - SciPy is a scientific computation library that uses NumPy underneath. SciPy stands for Scientific Python.It provides more utility functions for optimization, stats and signal processing.
